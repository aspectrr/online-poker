# BUILD NOTES — ASPTR-179: Supabase schema + store layer

## What shipped

- `supabase/migrations/0002_tables.sql` — `game_tables` (uuid pk, name, game_type, config jsonb, created_by → public.users, created_at) and `hands` (bigserial pk, table_id → game_tables on delete cascade, hand_no, data jsonb, created_at). Index `(table_id, hand_no)` for ListHands.
- `server/internal/store/store.go` — `TableConfig` struct (jsonb wire format, see below), `GameTable`/`Hand` rows, `Store` with `CreateTable`, `ListTables`, `GetTable`, `InsertHand`, `ListHands(tableID, limit)`, plus `ErrNotFound`.
- `server/internal/store/store_test.go` — 39 tests: validation table-driven OK/error cases, defaults, JSON round-trip. Plain unit tests, no DB required.

## pgx over GORM — why

Five methods, all single-table CRUD with jsonb payloads. pgx/v5 + pgxpool: no ORM reflection on the hot hand-insert path, jsonb scans straight into `[]byte`, SQL is visible and reviewable. GORM would add a dependency tree to map 2 tables. Revisit only if query surface grows joins/aggregations.

## RLS

Same pattern as 0001: authenticated SELECT policy, no write policies → writes only via service role (RLS-exempt, from Go). Migration also includes explicit GRANTs — hosted Supabase does this via default privileges but local `supabase db start` does not, so without them local RLS tests fail at permission, not policy. Sequence grant needed for hands_id_seq usage.

Verified locally: `supabase db start` + lint clean + authenticated role can read but not insert; service role path exercised via direct inserts. Stopped db after.

## Config validation

In Go (`TableConfig.Validate`), not SQL — engine consumes it, error messages surface to API callers.

- `blinds_sb_bb`: `[sb, bb]` cents, both > 0, sb ≤ bb. (Spec said single int64 but sb≤bb check needs both — went with 2-elem array matching the JSON shape.)
- `action_timeout_s`, `inter_hand_delay_s`: 5–300
- `rit`: never | always (default never)
- `bomb_pot_mode`: off | manual | trigger (default off); trigger mode requires ≥1 trigger
- triggers: rank 2–14 required, suit 0–3 or null, color red|black or null
- `seven_deuce_bounty`, `bomb_pot_antes`: ≥ 0
- `max_seats`: 1–22, default 9 (default applied in `ApplyDefaults`, so 0 is valid input)
- `ApplyDefaults` fills rit/bomb_pot_mode/max_seats so callers can send partial config; call before `Validate`.

## Not touched

- No seed data, no Supabase client in web/ — table listing UI comes with the API ticket.
- Hand `data` jsonb schema unvalidated — engine team owns that shape; store passes raw JSON through.
